# Parallax

A [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site that displays two-and-a-half-dimensional images I created from some of my photographs. [Visit the site!](https://parallax.tim-phillips.com/)

The parallax effect is implemented with [parallax.js](https://github.com/wagerfield/parallax).

## Development

- Run `yarn develop` to start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at http://localhost:8000.

## Deployment
